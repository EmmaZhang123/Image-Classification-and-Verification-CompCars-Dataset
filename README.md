# Image-Classification-and-Verification-CompCars-Dataset
The field of computer vision, particularly in
automotive applications, has experienced rapid advancements,
making it highly relevant for developing intelligent
transportation systems and autonomous vehicles. In this
report, we utilize the CompCars [1] dataset to conduct three
primary tasks: car make classification, car part classification,
and car make verification using state-of-the-art deep learning
techniques. These tasks are crucial for improving vehicle
recognition systems, contributing significantly to both academic
research and practical applications in the automotive industry.
Our approach involved training convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) including ResNet and GoogLeNet with different types
of loss to increase accuracy in car make classification and
car part classification, enabling identification of different car
manufacturers. In the car make verification task, we employed a
Siamese network architecture to measure the similarity between
pairs of images, achieving reliable verification of car makes.
Our models demonstrated high accuracy in some of the tasks,
with significant improvements over baseline methods. These
results provide a robust benchmark for future research and
can be integrated into commercial products, such as automated
vehicle inspection systems and intelligent traffic monitoring,
offering substantial benefits in terms of efficiency and accuracy.
